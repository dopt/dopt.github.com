          <h3>Welcome to Dopt's application Pages.</h3>

<p>Hello people.<br/>
   This is a page where I will be posting my side-projects, mostly using HTML5 and javascript as tools.<br/>
   The projects include any types of application, mostly:<br/>
   <pre>
     <code>
       Notes
       Games
       Drawings
       ...
     </code>
   </pre>
</p>


<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>I'm a Computer Science university student, who likes cool stuff and people.<br/>
   Logic, Maths is my favourite things that motivates me to move on, but sometimes is getting lazy, especially something that I'm not interested to.<br/>
   Mystery cases and psychology have also influence me quite a bit.<br/>
   Feel free to give me suggestions, or ideas of making new web-application, I will response to it as soon as I could.
</p>
