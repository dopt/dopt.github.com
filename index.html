          <h3>Welcome to Dopt's application Pages.</h3>

<p>Hello people.<br/>
   This is a page where I will be posting my side-projects, mostly using HTML5 and javascript as tools.<br/>
   The projects include any types of application, mostly:<br/>
   <pre>
     <code>
       Notes
       Games
       Drawings
       ...
     </code>
   </pre>

<h3>Time to change!</h3>
<p>
  Early August of 2013, this is the first time I develop an android app. It's really convenient and many library
  to be used. However, the emulator that used in Eclipse is too slow to response! I think most probably is my 
  laptop's speed problem. So, I'm forced to use real device(my phone) to test and run the app. It's a good idea
  if didnt't used long. The phone is auto charged when plug-in USB cable in laptop, so the phone is charged 
  even it's 100% full, which makes me worry that the phone's battery will be spoiled and battery's life span
  will be shortened.<br/> A good platform but troublesome to choose AVD or real device to test apps.
</p>

<h3>Why use dopt?</h3>

<p>
  It's not actually my real name. Dopt is the first satisfying name that I use to generate by codes using C++.<br/>
  Maybe I will use a better algorithm to create a cooler name, and replace it. Not that soon anyway.
</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>I'm a Computer Science university student, who likes cool stuff and people, and can be awkward with people I know.<br/>
   Logic, Maths is my favourite things that motivates me to move on, but sometimes is getting lazy, especially something that I'm not interested to.<br/>
   Mystery cases and psychology have also influence me quite a bit.<br/>
   Feel free to give me suggestions, or ideas of making new web-application, I will response to it as soon as I could.
